          <p>.NET is the Microsoft Web services strategy to connect information, people, systems, and devices through software. Integrated across the Microsoft platform, .NET technology provides the ability to quickly build, deploy, manage, and use connected, security-enhanced solutions with Web services.</p>
     <p> Bill Gates himself says ".NET will be one of the best platforms to work on."</p>
  <h2> &nbsp; Java</h2>
                    <div class="image_wrapper_01"><img src="images/java logo1.jpg" alt="image" width="350" height="150" /></div>
                   <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language (OOP) for Web browsers. It is organized around data rather than actions. Java is used for both server and client processing. Java was released in 1995 by Sun Micro Systems. Java is very similar to the popular C++ programming language. They both are object-oriented programming, using similar syntax and general forms for commands. However, Java is more secure since it doesn’t support pointers, which hold the address of other variables. It emerged with more self-contained variables.</p>
  <h2>&nbsp; C#</h2>
                    <div class="image_wrapper_01"><img src="images/c logo.jpg" alt="image" width="350" height="150" /></div>
                   <p>C# syntax is highly expressive, yet it is also simple and easy to learn. The curly-brace syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++ or Java. Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to begin to work productively in C# within a very short time.</p>
  <h2>&nbsp; Networking</h2>
                    <div class="image_wrapper_01"><img src="images/ntwrking logo.jpg" alt="image" width="350" height="150" /></div>
                <p>In Information Technology, Networking is the construction, design, and use of a network, including the physical (cabling, hub, bridge, switch, router, and so forth), the selection and use of telecommunication protocol and computer software for using and managing the network, and the establishment of operation policies and procedures related to the network.</p>
